## FRITZ!Box DVB-C List to CSV
- With the script mentioned, it is possible to create a CSV file with the station names and their frequencies from a cable Fritzbox, with which you can further process the data yourself (e.g. as a data source for a pivot table in Microsoft Excel) in order to create your own station list from it.
- The script is available as a Bash script for Linux-based distros and also for Windows as PowerShell.
- **Subject to malfunctions.**
